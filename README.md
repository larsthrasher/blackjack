My take on classic Blackjack/21 game for my first project at General Assembly.. 


For my first project I'll recreate my favorite card game Black Jack. The objectve of the game is to get a hand with cards representing the highest value, not exceeding 21. The cards will be depicted on screen and can be clicked on to draw a new card. There will be atleast a cpu dealer, and another player...perhaps upwards of two players (not user), and cpu dealer. I hope to implement DOM manipulation and ternary switch to accomplish card drawing and comparison.

Technologies used- HTML/CSS/Vanilla Javascript

The design of the landing page will be a simple title. Once title is clicked on, player is linked to an index page where game is played. Upon winning, perhaps a fun event will enact, like cards jumping around a la microsoft solitaire.

I think the major problem I'll come across is randomization of cards, converting and comparing values, automating the dealer response, and manipulation of elements in the GUI for user interface. I plan on handling all this with javascript and DOM manipulation.

Time permitting, assuming MVP has been met, I would like to add the capability to annie up and bet.
